# Disaster AutoNLP
 
 The project is just to get a hands on experience on the AutoNLP library bulit by [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/autonlp).
 
 The dataset is taken from Kaggle on Disaster Tweets. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview)
 
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.  
Therefore, have built multiple models using autonlp and compare models to best server the purpose.
